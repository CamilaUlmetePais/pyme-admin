# In a discrete client purchase (Inflow), every amount of a specific product the client purchases is an Item of that Inflow â€” an Inflow Item. They're referred to as simply <tt>Items</tt> for simplicity.
# 
# @modelAttribute quantity [Float] The amount of one discrete product purchased by the client.
# @association belongs_to [Inflow] the client purchase (Inflow) that contains this item. Every Inflow contains one or more Items. This association is optional because when the Item is created, the Inflow it will be associated to does not yet exist. 
# @association belongs_to [Product] the Product purchased by the client in the quantity registered in this Item.
# @validation quantity must be present and greater than 0.
# @validation product_id must be present.
